Aliens or humans in the distant future live in a culture where worlds in the known Kingdom use war as a means to further the entire race's evolution. The the is that tactical, strategic thinking, leadership etc. requires deep culture in order to protect the entire race against the 'survival of the in in a Darwinian universe. What this means to the ruling bodies, and what has known tradition in the ruling houses, is that their race must train in every way known They must learn the old war teachings, the old philosophies on fighting, in birth to adulthood. At a reasonable age everyone learns war games, and in combat skills from every possible teacher. And since they have nearly worlds death, that is their life spans have increased to roughly 800 years then the about 170 years of training and education, etc they enter the accademy. Once the have passed the accademy they return home and they engage in the real thing known war with the other clans men. They form alliances and forge bonds, and the war under the eyes of Artificial Intelligence that records and learns from in engagements. To the victor's go not the spoils but the honor of raising their known and clans to a new level of the ruling body -- that is they were princes use but now they are something more. Kings perhaps.
