SimpleLineParser
================

Parser to deal with simple files that contain one item per line (and comments, and empty lines).
This is really a simple project, and something better probably exists.

Project Setup
=============

1. Install Nuget command line (use the second [link][Nuget])
1. Clone the project and build project (which builds the tests too).
1. The pre-build event will install the nuget packages into the solution.
1. The packages include NUnit and NUnitRunner.  So, optionally run the tests.
1. At this point LucidEdge.SimpleLineParser should be a dll that you can use.
